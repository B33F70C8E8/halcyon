OK, you might be here because you might be wondering why no issues on GitHub Jack??? Why only must submit a PR????

Ok first of all, I really dislike the way the issues tab is only a part of GitHub meaning I really don't get to see it
on my end without some fancy software that I might have to install. The latter is that I have been using this format
for most if not all my projects. It enables me to view said issues in a very compact list form-factor; without the
stupid reliance on stuff like "eye-candy" to make it actually workable. 

Now the other reasons is that I can see these stuffs without needing some network connection (guranteeing that I have the latest
version).

Ok everything clear? (Ok please shut up if you have any silly BS that you comment saying this format is something like "cringie" or "shitty")

[!] ==Submitting a Bug OR a program report==
> A program report or a bug is something that details something that hinders the software's (s') original intended capability.

To submit one, you submit a PR to the file BUGS.txt with your issue number, which you can find with the latest number in that file;
note: yes you have to update that number as new reports are accepted and your's isn't (idc)

Then you need 3 mandatory fields you must have to fill out:
1. Detailed Description
2. Testing
3. State

Optional Fields:
1. Difficulty
2. Status
3. Potential Fix

[ Follow other accepted issues' templates to understand what the heck your doing ok? ]

If you have a potential fix to the problem, then you are very well to attach your own solution to your PR; unless I veto your BS.

[!] ==Submitting a Feature Request OR a program improvement==
> A feature request is something that details something that benefits the program, like maybe accept different frequencies?

A feature request is very similar to a bug report; however key differences:
1. The file is now called FEATURES.txt
2. ->
Mandatory Fields: 
  1. Detailed Description
  2. Category [Program Dynamic, Potential Optimization, Visual Comfort]
Optional Fields:
  1. Status

Now for the category part, please don't pull some random obscure category out of your ass, just use the ones listed above.

[?] Questions?
If you have questions, literally just ask me. 

You can submit a blank PR or just email me and I will hopefully respond unless you asked some trivial or rhetorical BS.

Thanks.
