[***] #2 "Folders that have been deleted should also be removed from the attributes view"
      Detailed Description: Folders should not be kept for ever in the attributes view once
                            they have been marked for deletion by the user.
      Potential Fix: Keep track if the folder exists or not

[!FIXED!] [***] #1 "Folders without acceptable Audio Files will enter in with unqualified blank file names"
      Detailed Description: Folders that do not contain any extension ruled files will still enter
      as unqualified with empty names instead of proper names or no at all.
